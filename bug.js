This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or component lifecycle events where data might not be available immediately. 

```javascript
// Example: Trying to access a property of a null object
const user = await getUserData(); // getUserData might return null
console.log(user.name); // Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')
```
