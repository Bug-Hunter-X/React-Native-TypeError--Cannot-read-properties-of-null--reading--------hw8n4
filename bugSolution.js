The solution involves using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to safely access properties.  Optional chaining allows you to safely access nested properties without causing an error if any part of the chain is null or undefined. Nullish coalescing allows you to provide a default value if the expression before `??` is null or undefined.

```javascript
// Example: Using optional chaining and nullish coalescing
const user = await getUserData();
console.log(user?.name ?? 'Guest'); // Uses 'Guest' if user or user.name is null/undefined
```

This approach handles the potential `null` or `undefined` values gracefully, preventing the error.  In React components, always ensure that data is available before attempting access, often by using conditional rendering based on state or props.

For more robust error handling, you might add explicit checks:

```javascript
const user = await getUserData();
if (user) {
  console.log(user.name);
} else {
  console.log('User data not available yet');
}
```
Choosing between these options depends on your preference and coding style; the key is to avoid accessing properties of objects that could be null or undefined.
